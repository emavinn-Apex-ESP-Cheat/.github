## 🔍 What Is the Apex ESP Cheat?

ESP stands for **Extra Sensory Perception** — a cheat overlay that gives you **live data about players, items, and events** through the game’s UI. It's not a wild rage hack — it’s a tactical cheat used to out-position and out-play anyone before they can even react.

And the best part? It’s fully customizable and looks **clean + legit** when configured right.
